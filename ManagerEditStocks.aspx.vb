    '=========== HELLO FROM NICOLE ====================

    'Hey Leah! Okay, so I set up the gridview. It's all on the aspx page -- essentially you turn the column into a TemplateField, 
    'then turn the "template" to anything you want--textbox, calendar, imagebutton, etc.
    'to reference the cell, you have to do something a bit weird. You can see CustomerPayBills for working code, but essentially you have to take
    'whatever's in the cell and create a virtual textbox, then call that:

    'Dim t As TextBox = DirectCast(gvMyPayees.Rows(i).Cells(4).FindControl("txtAmount"), TextBox)
    'and then you use t.Text to pull the values.
    'Kind of convoluted, but it works. 

    'Let me know if you have any questions! Hope this helps :)
